## Overview

This PCB is designed for my Speaker amplifier subsystem. It includes all major circuit stages: voltage regulation, transistor smlifier pair, diodes, connectors, and test points for measurements and troubleshooting. It uses a two layer board with a griund plane. The layout was made to meet Peralta mill specifications. The board passed the design rule check with no major errors. Gerber and drill files were generated and prepared for manufacturing submission.
