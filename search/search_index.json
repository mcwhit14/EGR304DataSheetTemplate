The System uses a Sensor Module, Control Hub, and a Audio output module. My subsystem connects to the control hub via a digital signal to the Hub microcontroller. When the poteniometer changes state or a button is press a PWM signal is sent to my board where its filtered and amplified through a Op amp and transistors This will drive a small buzzer to provide clear and immediate audio responses for user notifications.[team report.](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/</p>","tags":[]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>I independently built the speaker subsystem for team 101.
